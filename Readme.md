Sure, here's the full documentation for the `my_calculator` project:

## Example Calculator Unit Testing Project in DevOps
The `my_calculator` project is a simple calculator application written in Python that includes unit tests to ensure that the application functions correctly. The project includes a `calculator.py` file that defines a `Calculator` class with methods for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It also includes separate test files for each of these methods in the `tests` directory.

```
my_calculator/
├── calculator.py
└── tests/
    ├── __init__.py
    ├── test_addition.py
    ├── test_division.py
    ├── test_multiplication.py
    └── test_subtraction.py
```

Here is an overview of the files in the project:

### `calculator.py`
The `calculator.py` file defines a `Calculator` class with four methods for performing arithmetic operations: `addition`, `subtraction`, `multiplication`, and `division`.

### `tests/test_addition.py`
The `test_addition.py` file defines a test function that tests the `addition` method of the `Calculator` class.

### `tests/test_subtraction.py`
The `test_subtraction.py` file defines a test function that tests the `subtraction` method of the `Calculator` class.

### `tests/test_multiplication.py`
The `test_multiplication.py` file defines a test function that tests the `multiplication` method of the `Calculator` class.

### `tests/test_division.py`
The `test_division.py` file defines a test function that tests the `division` method of the `Calculator` class.

### Running the Unit Tests
To run the unit tests, you can use a testing framework like `pytest`. To run all the tests in the `tests` directory, navigate to the project directory and run the following command:
```
pytest
```

This will run all the test files in the `tests` directory and display the results in the console.

### Integrating into a DevOps Pipeline
Unit testing is a critical part of the DevOps process, and this project can be integrated into a DevOps pipeline to ensure that the calculator application works as expected and to catch any potential bugs or issues before they make it into production. The unit tests can be run automatically as part of the continuous integration and deployment process using tools like Jenkins, Travis CI, or CircleCI.

By following the best practices for unit testing and integrating testing into your DevOps pipeline, you can ensure that your code is of high quality and reliability and meets the needs and expectations of your users.
